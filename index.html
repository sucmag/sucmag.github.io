<h2>WELCOME TO <b>SUC MAG</b>.<br>
	A MAGAZINE THAT IS GOOD.</h2>
	<p>Southern Utah Culture Magazine is the newest voice for arts, music, and you guessed it, culture in the Southern Utah area. We know that was probably hard to piece together from the name, which is why we took a second to explain it to you. Because we care.<br><br>
		We've only been around for a little bit, but we are passionate about the things that are happening in our community. We asked ourselves why no one was talking about the things we were interested in, and figured out the answer was "Stop asking questions and do it yourselves."<br><br>
		So we did.</p>
