		<h2>SHINE BRIGHT</h2>
		<p>Shine Bright, one of St. George's premiere hardcore bands, is getting ready to embark on a new tour and release a new album. We sat down with members Zane Watrous(singer), Taylor Neilson (bassist), and Spencer 'Ginger’ Sorensen (drums); to talk about the history of Shine Bright as well as their upcoming EP and tour.<br><br>

		<p><b>When and how did Shine Bright start?</b>
			<p><b><i>Zane:</i></b> "Basically we've been a band for over 2 years now. After several member changes, and over 10 tours, we've finally found the right group."

			<p><b><i>Ginger:</i></b> "Yeah, it started with Zane and I deciding music was going to be a career, not just a fun side project. Got some members together, some of which have left, [and] finally got a good crew with a lot of different influences."

			<p><b><i>Taylor:</i></b> "I got back into music in 2015, playing drums for a band called Kingdoms, which was short lived. (2015-2017) SB's then guitarist had medical issues and wasn't able to tour in Feb of 2017. I said I would fill in. After the tour, things just never worked out with the old guitarist and I became a permanent member." <br><br>

		<p><b>Where did you get the name "Shine Bright?"</b>
			<p><b><i>Zane:</i></b> "The name Shine Bright comes from a band called Break Even, and their song October 27th."

			<p><b><i>Taylor:</i></b> "I always thought it was from Rihanna's ‘shine bright like a diamond.' "<br><br>

		<p><b>What makes Shine Bright's sound different than other hardcore bands?</b>
			<p><b><i>Zane:</i></b> "We strive for equal parts nostalgic post-hardcore, and innovation. I think it gives us a vibe that no one I've heard of has.”

			<p><b><i>Ginger:</i></b> "We have a heavy sounds, with a melodic sounds, but also a very soft sound. Pleasing to a lot of different audiences, unable to be identified into one genre."

			<p><b><i>Taylor:</i></b> "Locally, I don't thinkg theres any other band that sounds like SB. There's a lot of like Indie/Shoegaze bands around town. SB has that post hardcore feel, thats not screamo or metal, but driving parts and super melodic guitars over heavier style vocals and singing."<br><br>

		<p><b>What challenges do you face being in Southern Utah?</b>

			<p><b><i>Zane:</i></b> "The biggest challenge of being a band in St George is the lack of the bigger bands touring through, and the show opportunities they bring."

			<p><b><i>Ginger:</i></b> "The community has very very little 'night life' and no decent sized venues for us to play, the only venues around are ones that we are able to exceed max occupancy."

			<p><b><i>Taylor:</i></b> "Oh yes. Theres definitely a struggle getting people to come out and support local music at shows. The market here for music is a constant up and down. Not to mention that people of StG like that "small town feel" and aren't really open for bigger changes in the music scene here. Jazzy's just re-opened and while it was out, shows were being held at David Hutters personal studio. With Jazzy being back, hopefully the scene will thrive again."<br><br>

		<p><b>And whats the best part?</b>
			<p><b><i>Zane:</i></b>"Best part? Having a vehicle for free travel with my best friends, Meeting other rad bands all the time, and having a national network."

			<p><b><i>Ginger:</i></b> "Seeing the progression within the band just so far. Seeing people from different states singing the music back to us that we've written. Being able to enjoy life to the fullest not necessarily working a 9-5 job."

			<p><b><i>Taylor:</i></b> "Oh man I love seeing new bands pop up for sure. Gives us more variety and opportunities to play with different bands, rather than the same 3 bands every month, you know?"<br><br>

		<p><b>How about touring? What favorite memories do you have there?</b>

			<p><b><i>Zane:</i></b> "So many memories to pin. One great memory I have was standing on the shore of Lake Michigan and realizing how far this band has taken me."

			<p><b><i>Ginger:</i></b> "Honestly couldn't say just one, it's all the little ones, waking up freezing cold in the middle of nowhere, with all of your friends in a van with a smile on your face. Signing a shirt or poster for someone with tears running down their face because a part in a song hit them the right way."

			<p><b><i>Taylor:</i></b> "Im not going to get into too much detail, but Boise, ID on our last August tour. That was quite a crazy night! But a few days later we played San Diego, CA, and we stayed on a 50 ft sail boat in the harbor. That was really cool."<br><br>

		<p><b>Tell us about the new album</b>

			<p><b><i>Zane:</i></b> "Our new EP, 'More Wild Than The Wind' is our second EP we've put out. We're very excited to be under the wing of Standby Records with the release. MWTTW was largely a collection of thoughts based on this emerging adulthood transition that we're all faced with. Expectations vs. Desires, friends moving on in life, people growing apart, seeing family grow old and frail, loss. Our first EP Lantern was an ode to good times in the past, MWTTW is the transition period, and our next full length with be a lot more about where we are now in life."<br><br>
