       <p>For Nevermind, one of southern Utah's most popular local bands, it all started with a cup of coffee.</p>

       <p>Nevermind is a self-described 80s emo hardcore band from St. George. Though only recently formed, the band
         is making waves in the southern Utah music scene, competing in Jazzy Java’s battle of the bands and even touring
         the nation.</p>

         <p>Lead singer Austin Mariano says the band’s earliest stages began while he was working making coffee at Dixie
           State University for McCabe Johnson, and while they were talking they realized they were into the same type of music. </p>

           <p>“I met McCabe naturally through human interaction and finding out we like the same type of music,” Austin said. “I met
             others just in the scene here in St. George and it all happened naturally.”</p>

           <p>Nevermind is composed of Austin Mariano on guitar and vocals, Dylan Martinez on guitar, McCabe Johnson on Drums and Kolton Leishman on bass.</p>

           <p>The band is just returning from its third official tour, performing in states across the pacific northwest, including Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Montana.</p>

           <p>Nevermind’s unique sound combines melodic guitar with heavy drums and bass. It’s members say they’re influenced by a spectrum of artists ranging from The 1975 all
             the way to music reminiscent of their middle school days like Underoath and Hawthorne Heights. </p>

             <p>Nevermind will be playing along side Hail The Sun on Sep 5 at the new Jazzy Java Location on Sunset Blvd.</p>

           <p>“It should be one of the biggest shows here in St. George in the last few years,” Austin said. </p>

           <p>With multiple large bands coming through as well as the hype surrounding the opening of the new Jazzys Austin might just be right.</p>
